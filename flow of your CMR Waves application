🔁 Full Application Flow
🏠 1. User Lands on index.html
They see the welcome page introducing CMR Waves.

A “Login” button in the header navigates to login.html.

🔐 2. User Submits login.html Form
Inputs: username and email

Username is stored in localStorage for later display on the dashboard.

Form posts the email to send_otp.php.

📧 3. send_otp.php Generates & Sends OTP
A random OTP is generated (using rand()).

OTP and email are saved in $_SESSION.

PHPMailer sends the OTP to the provided email address.

User is redirected to verify_otp.php.

🔑 4. User Proceeds to verify_otp.php
(You currently have OTP resend logic here—consider replacing this with a verification form.)

Proper flow:

User enters the OTP.

The script checks if it matches $_SESSION['otp'].

On success: $_SESSION['verified_user'] = true

Redirect to dashboard.html

🎧 5. Accessing dashboard.html
On load, user info is pulled from localStorage:

Email prefix becomes the username

First letter becomes user profile circle

Page includes:

Header with user info + sign out

Navigation panel (Home, Songs, Podcasts, Broadcast, Courses)

Music player and category-specific sections

🎶 6. Exploring the Songs Section
User selects a language (e.g., Tamil, Telugu…)

JavaScript dynamically loads songs from the predefined object

Clicking a song plays it in the custom audio player at the bottom

⚙️ 7. Account Settings + Theme Toggle
Users can:

Upload a profile image (shown on dashboard)

Fill in contact info and a short bio

Switch between light and dark modes

🔚 8. User Clicks Sign Out
Currently shows an alert()

(Recommendation: clear localStorage + redirect to login.html)
